# 🌸 Ghibli-Inspired AI Workflow using ComfyUI

This project showcases a Ghibli-style image generation workflow built using **ComfyUI**, **ChatGPT**, **ControlNet**, and a **Ghibli LoRA model** sourced from *CivitAI*. The goal is to create stylized visuals inspired by Studio Ghibli using a structured AI pipeline.

---

## ✨ Overview

Using poses guided by **ControlNet**, and stylization with a **Ghibli LoRA**, this workflow produces dreamlike, animation-inspired imagery reminiscent of classic Ghibli scenes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Models Used

- **ComfyUI** – Modular, node-based UI for AI image generation workflows
- **ControlNet** – Used for controlling pose and structure of generated characters
- **Ghibli LoRA** – Style model from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/) used to replicate Studio Ghibli's visual tone
- **Stable Diffusion** – Base model for image synthesis

---

## 🖼️ Workflow Features

- 🎨 **Ghibli LoRA Integration**  
  Apply the unique charm of Ghibli aesthetics to any image prompt.

- 🧍‍♀️ **Pose Control with ControlNet**  
  Guide character positions and layout using pose detection (OpenPose or similar models).

- 🔁 **Modular Workflow in ComfyUI**  
  Easily tweak, extend, and visualize the pipeline for custom results.
